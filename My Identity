- 👋 Hello, this is Tilungile, welcome to my profile
- 👀 I'm one person who is very into technology, mechanics and problem solving. I enjoy these things with all my heart.
- 🌱 Currently I've just began my ALX Software engineering course and soon be doing data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the different coding languages. I'm still a beginner and so I need all the help I could get.
- 📫 If by any means you want to contact me, you can email tilungile.s65@gmail.com. I'll try by all means to get back to you as soon as possible.
